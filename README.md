## Mission objectives

- Be able to use Data visualisation libraries.(Matplotlib and/or Seaborn)
- Be able to establish conclusions about a dataset. 
## The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales.

**Step 1 : Data Cleaning**
    We had to discuss and analyse datas to see which ones we had to keep and wich ones to remove.
    For exemple as the price is our target , we get rid of scrapped house/appartment where the price wasn't mentionned.
- The previously scrapped datas from Immoweb.be :  
    ##### Before cleaning :
    - [csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDropsy/Challenge--Data-Analysis/master/Final_dataset_house_apartment.csv?token=AOY7FALZF3F5HEK3T3FN3527MSXAU")
    ##### After cleaning :
    - [cleaned csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDropsy/Challenge--Data-Analysis/master/filtered_dataset_house_appartment.csv?token=AOY7FAJ744R6OBO5HT3HEM27MSW7G "cleaned csv file")
    
**Step 2 : Data Analysis**

**Step 3 : Data Interpretation**
